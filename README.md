Self-Hosted Agent Why?
So, there's lots of reasons why you would want to host
your own build agents.
And one is because maybe you have an already pre-existing
build agent like a Jenkins server
or something on premise that you're using.
Another reason would be to lock down
the rights to use those build agents.
Maybe you have security parameters that you need to use
and maybe it's behind a firewall,
(which we'll discuss in the next lesson)
but maybe there are certain access permissions.
Another reason could be that you're using
Team Foundation Server and you need to have your CI server
centralized in that kind of non-distributed way
and have everything under the control
of that Team Foundation Server.
